 *
 * @param options.prompt - A prompting message for the player taking the action
 * to decide between their choices.

 *
 * @param options.expand - If set to true, rather than select the action
 * directly, the player will be prompted to make the first choice in the action.
 * For example, if a `playCard` action was supplied here and the player had to
 * choose a card to play, rather than present the player with an explicit choice
 * to 'play' they would simply be asked to choose a card. Default true.

 * @param options.skipIfOnlyOne - If set to true, if there is only valid action
 * to take amongst the choices given, the game will attempt to take the move
 * automatically, prompting the player for any choices that would need to be
 * made to complete this action. Default false.
